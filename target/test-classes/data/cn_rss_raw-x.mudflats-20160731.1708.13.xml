<p>Note those talons, among the longest among all birds. The Osprey feeds almost exclusively on fish – another name for them is Fishhawk – and however slippery a fish might be, it&#8217;s unlikely to escape those talons.</p>
<p>Osprey need about 100-115 days to raise their kids:  Three days from completion of the nest to lay the eggs; about 37 days to incubate the eggs to hatching; 50-55 days to fledge and 10-15 days to be ready to migrate. Longer if they have to build the nest from scratch.  If you are going to eat fish, obviously you need the water to be unfrozen. So perhaps this is a species which will benefit from global warming.</p>
<p>But Osprey are indisputably breeding in Interior Alaska.</p>
<div id="attachment_47379" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/700OSPR2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-47379" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/700OSPR2.jpg" alt="Osprey Nest, Interior Alaska" width="700" height="467" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Osprey Nest, Interior Alaska</p></div>
<p>Osprey hunt by stooping, diving feet first, on fish in the top three feet or so of the water column. They are quite successful at foraging, and, since DDT was banned, quite successful at breeding. Osprey were severely impacted by the egg shall-thinning effets of DDT.</p>
<p>Osprey are among the most studied raptors, including some research done by Mrs. WC on the Ospreys at Cascade Lake, a reservoir in central Idaho. And this is a cosmopolitan species, found everywhere there is open water with fishing sufficient numbers to support big birds, across Europe and Asia. The North American populations winter in Central and South America. WC saw them in Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost tip of South America.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationofchange.org/news/2016/07/25/sad-showing-left-cleveland/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-47449 size-large" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Web-WedJuly220-RNC2016-15-of-90-630x414.jpg" alt="Web-WedJuly220-RNC2016 (15 of 90)" width="630" height="414" />[Originally published in NationofChange.org]</a></p>
<p>The big attraction on the protest front, during the RNC this past week was a human wall around Trump&#8217;s RNC security wall. It was an idea that seemed fantastic once you first heard it, but it was something that needed good numbers and a willing group of protestors. It made for good images &#8211; but as was the theme for the week &#8211; the numbers were too small.</p>
<p>While immigrant rights groups like United We Dream and some others took a strong stand in Ohio &#8211; few others showed. The numbers were too small to pull off anything that made a profound statement against the literal fascist that the Republican Party was nominating. Estimates put the largest protests in the hundreds &#8211; photojournalists outnumbered the activists.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-47443 size-large" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rudy-1-630x447.jpg" alt="Rudy-1" width="630" height="447" /></p>
<p>In a week that saw Family Research Council&#8217;s Tony Perkins spew bigoted hate, Rudy Giuliani fear monger and other Republicans do everything from threaten to strangle Hillary Clinton to tying her to the Devil.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-47444 size-large" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Trump-NOC_1-630x427.jpg" alt="Trump-NOC_1" width="630" height="427" /></p>
<p>The left made the conscious decision to not confront a man that as president would (if we are to believe his words, and I do) put people in camps, declare entire swaths of people criminals, just for existing &#8211; and cut benefits for tens of millions.</p>
<p>This is to not mention the overall effect that a Trump Presidency would have on the safety of many minorities in this country from his supporters.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-47446" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Web-RNC-ThursJuly21-6-630x420.jpg" alt="Web-RNC-ThursJuly21-6" width="630" height="420" /></p>
<p>Other than the ever present Code Pink and Bob Avakain devotees, I was hard pressed to find any group outside the Immigrant rights movement making a real show of numbers in Cleveland.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-47442" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CodePink-Allie-1-630x456.jpg" alt="CodePink-Allie-1" width="630" height="456" /></p>
<p>No large anti-fracking messaging in a state that already has water issues that rise to the level of Flint. No anti-war protestors from ANSWER or UFJP to speak against a party that called for the carpet bombing of the Middle East. Maybe the most important electoral college state in the union was too far to drive, or they were too busy setting up in Philly protesting the Democratic Party, I don&#8217;t know. But they should be ashamed. If Phil Ochs were still alive today he&#8217;d be singing where were you in Cleveland? Unfortunately he&#8217;s no longer with us.</p>
<p>At least for now we have the groups like United We Dream, Mijente, Youth Empowered in the Struggle and the It Takes Roots Caravan to hold us over until the rest of us get over Bernie and realize that real change happens on the ground.</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zsEssXU3Fk?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>*It needs to be noted that there were many individuals that made their presence heard in Cleveland from larger groups, like Iraq Veterans Against the War, Black Lives Matter more local organizations. This is meant to be a call out to the larger left &#8211; to show up and be counted &#8211; not meant to call out individuals.</p>

Are you suffering from political nostalgia? Was your dipnetting or berry picking interrupted this week by the Republican Convention? Do you long for the days where the inexperienced candidate with narcissistic qualities and a private email problem was wrapped into one person — Sarah Palin?</p>
<p>Does it seem strange to you that David Duke, a white nationalist, Holocaust-denying, former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan thinks the time is perfect for him to run for U.S. Senate instead of secretly folding white hoods and watching episodes of Archie Bunker in an actual bunker?</p>
<p>Are you still saying &#8220;All Lives Matter&#8221; when you have seen an unarmed behavioral therapist trying to help an autistic man, lay on the ground with his hands up, get shot by the police?</p>
<p>Does a wall on the north side of Texas sound like a good idea when you hear a rape victim was jailed for a month after she left the courtroom and refused to testify against the convicted serial rapist who had raped her?</p>
<p>Remember when mass shootings were &#8220;breaking news&#8221; and not just a regularly occurring news story with location and body count changes?</p>
<p>It seems bad. It seems worse than before. It seems like George W. Bush, smiling and dancing at a funeral for fallen police officers, was not really that inappropriate.</p>
<p>My local public radio station played speeches live from the RNC in Cleveland this week. Normally our little Kachemak Bay radio station is salted with tide tables and weather reports. I brace myself a little bit for the Bush Lines – radio messages for people without phones. See, &#8220;Rose and Dawson&#8221; send each other love notes over the radio and they are so Hallmarky I&#8217;m rooting for them to break up or get better writers.</p>
<p>Hearing Rudy Giuliani, the patron saint of 9/11, who had apparently washed down a few Adderalls with a Red Bull, was pretty rough on my delicate dial. I suppose listening rather than watching saved me from the distraction of Donald Trump waving his tiny hands about. NPR&#8217;s commentators were pathetic in trying to be fair and balanced about the vitriolic hate speech and plagiarized passages. Convention enthusiasts struggled with the question, &#8220;When did America stop being great?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear Alaskans, I feel like we are watching a train wreck and can&#8217;t look away. The bigger problem is, we are viewing it from the track. I keep hearing people say they can&#8217;t wait for the election to be over. Really? That light ahead in the tunnel? It&#8217;s actually the train coming, not the other side. I&#8217;ve tried to channel my inner Molly Ivins and come up with something really clever to make myself feel better.</p>
<p>It feels like democracy has gone the way of climate change. There have been those screaming in the political wilderness a la John The Baptist, that we&#8217;re at a tipping point! Hear the voice of Scottie tell Capt. Kirk, &#8220;She can&#8217;t take much more of this, Captain!&#8221; Gerrymandering, election engineering, voter suppression, corporate money influence, media manipulation and vote flipping are all part of the seven seals peeling away to the apocalyptic implosion of our political system.</p>
<p>It feels like the world has gone mad. It&#8217;s felt like that to much of the world for a long time, and we seem to be catching up in the wrong direction. I&#8217;m struggling to stay plugged in with the intention to change the things I can&#8217;t accept. I realize there&#8217;s a Serenity Prayer that deals with acceptance, but I&#8217;m not ready to accept the demise of our country in order to find some short-term pocket of peace while looking at a pink sunset and listening to sea otters crack clams. Oh, it&#8217;s tempting to tune out of the chaos and into my favorite channel I call &#8220;On The Porch Television.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re reading a pep talk to myself. I was reminded this week that when I was born, the Vietnam War was raging and America was still trying to pull itself together after the public executions of President John Kennedy, Malcolm X, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sen. Robert Kennedy. Shortly afterward, the Kent State massacre and the Watergate break-ins occurred. The obvious difference to our dealing with chaos now versus then, were people like journalists Walter Cronkite, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and a few years before them, Edward R. Murrow.</p>
<p>This is the &#8220;buck up, little camper&#8221; part of my rant. Demand more from the media, which only create content to sell advertisement. They have no mandate to inform. If you don&#8217;t see it, stop watching. Demand more from the politicos. They need us to elect them, not visa versa. And for the love of all that is holy, don&#8217;t miss the pink sunsets. They help take care of that part of you that doesn&#8217;t want to give up.</p>

Maybe the migration instructions in their brains got wired wrong; maybe they are pioneers trying to expand the range. We&#8217;ll be looking at some vagrants intermittently the next few months. This isn&#8217;t a very good photo, but it is unique in one way: it&#8217;s the one of the first bird photos WC took.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are some birds that are vagrants, birds that turn up in Alaska but have no business – or anyone to breed with – in the area. Maybe the migration instructions in their brains got wired wrong; maybe they are pioneers trying to expand the range. We&#8217;ll be looking at some vagrants intermittently the next few months.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a very good photo, but it is unique in one way: it&#8217;s the one of the first bird photos WC took. In 1996, an Eurasian Bullfinch female turned up at a feeder on Rosie Creek Road, outside of Fairbanks, in the dark of winter.</p>
<div id="attachment_47306" style="width: 628px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EUBU20160614-374.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-47306" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/EUBU20160614-374.jpg" alt="Eurasian Bullfinch Female, Fairbanks, 1996" width="618" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Eurasian Bullfinch Female, Fairbanks, 1996</p></div>
<p>Among birders, this was the equivalent of a four alarm fire. Hard core birders came from as far away as New Jersey to add this species to the list of bird species they had seen in North America. The young woman in whose yard the bird would feed opened her house to strangers, even when she was at work and away from her home, so that birders could sit in a warm cabin instead of outside in the cold.</p>
<p>This Bullfinch is the most significant factor in how WC became interested in bird photography. In a real sense, this little passerine is the reason you&#8217;ve seen the 150-plus bird species here at the Mudflats that preceded it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Great Blue Heron is visual evidence that birds did indeed evolve from dinosaurs; when you see a Great Blue in flight, you can almost think you are seeing a pterodactyl. Great Blues are found in Alaska throughout Southeast and in Southcentral Alaska as far west as Seward. There are irregular reports from Cook Inlet.

<p>Great Blues are found in Alaska throughout Southeast and in Southcentral Alaska as far west as Seward. There are irregular reports from Cook Inlet.</p>

<p>Although this is primarily a fish eater, wading (often belly deep) along the shoreline of oceans, marshes, lakes, and rivers, it also hunts upland areas for rodents and other animals, especially in winter. It has been known to eat most animals that come within striking range.  You would be amazed at the size of prey a Great Blue can get down its throat.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">I was thinking about the retirement of Sen. Johnny Ellis this week. He has served Alaska for more than half the years we&#8217;ve been a state. It&#8217;s not a secret that I&#8217;m one of his most ardent fans and I am considering asking him for an 8-by-10 signed glossy photo to put on my desk to help me get through next year&#8217;s &#8220;Gavel to Gavel&#8221;coverage.  I wasn&#8217;t able to attend his retirement party because the sockeye were flooding Tutka Lagoon and they wouldn&#8217;t wait or find my fish smoker by themselves.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">I used to have a standard summer rant. It came from 20 years of living in Los Anchorage and driving to Kachemak Bay. What is with that one car? Oh, I don&#8217;t mean the guy who is poking along looking at all the &#8220;scenic view here&#8221; signs but the one right behind him. Who is that clown? The guy who won&#8217;t pass but won&#8217;t give enough room for anyone else to pass, either? He&#8217;s the equivalent of the buddy at a bar who makes sure you go home alone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">That rant is still valid but I&#8217;ve expanded it. You know who you are, and you should step aside for people who know how to drive. My new rant is about people and boats. I&#8217;ve been in some pretty hairy water — big enough to knock windows out of a 100-foot power scow, steep enough to have people on shore thinking I wouldn&#8217;t make it, and gnarly enough to make me hate crossing to come home in a bay full of 10-foot potholes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">I only explain this because the scariest place on the water in the summertime is a boat harbor. I get it, you&#8217;re a Seahawks fan and you bought a boat and painted it your team colors. Congratulations. Here&#8217;s some new rules that come with boat ownership: Boats don&#8217;t have brakes. Surprise! You want to be a hot rod for your lady on the bow who fancies herself a legged mermaid, but if you hit the fuel dock at top speed it might blow up or launch her over it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">Oh, and &#8220;right on return&#8221; is a rule for people who think because there are no yellow lines it&#8217;s a free-for-all. No Wake means something other than no alarm clock — it means slow down. Just because someone gave you a Greek fisherman&#8217;s hat for Father&#8217;s Day doesn&#8217;t mean you know how to drive a boat. I realize this is shocking. If you&#8217;d been gifted a tutu it wouldn&#8217;t make you a ballet star. But at least you wouldn&#8217;t be smashing into dancers at speeds to sink them in the harbor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">I&#8217;m ripping the lid off this little-known mystery: The wind has a different effect on boats than on cars. It can and will blow your boat around. People figured this out a long time ago and actually put sails on their boats. You having a motor doesn&#8217;t change this phenomenon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">So you know, snagging red salmon is the opposite of fly-fishing. No finesse needed, no magic touch, it&#8217;s just Neanderthal fishing. There isn&#8217;t any bait. Just throw in a treble hook, wait for it to sink down past the jumping humpies and jerk hard. Reel. Jerk. Reel. Jerk.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">Seriously, I enjoyed the lack of regulation on small boats because I was able to drive one before I could drive a car. Now, I don&#8217;t mean to be a grump, but for the love of God and all that is holy — if you&#8217;re going to buy a boat, go crazy and learn to drive it, dock it and learn some basic manners. How is not knowing rules of navigation making you safer? Think of it as another form of personal flotation device.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">I don&#8217;t want to name names, but try driving slow when you&#8217;re in a neighborhood with kids in rowboats and paddle-boarders. They don&#8217;t make for good speed bumps. Good grief. Oh, and if the cost recovery seiners are trying to set a net in the lagoon, pull your anchor and get out of their way. The thing is with boats, maybe the owners aren&#8217;t real jerks, but with the evidence of their driving, it doesn&#8217;t require some leap of logic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">Instead of going into wave rage, I am trying to channel my inner Johnny Ellis.  Johnny has always been the grown-up in the room. He knows the rules, all of them. He has had a sense of decorum and professionalism that, sadly, is rare with a citizen legislature. By sadly, I mean tragic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">Johnny Ellis has been fly-fishing with a bunch of snaggers for years. Thank you.  Alaska is a better place because of your service.</p>

<p>(Bonus points for identifying the four other species in this photo.) But they do range west as far as Interior Alaska during spring migration, although not every year.  There are breeding birds in the northeastern corner of Alaska&#8217;s Arctic coast, but generally Snow Geese breed in far northern Canada.</p>
<div id="attachment_47310" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/700SNGO2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-47310" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/700SNGO2.jpg" alt="Snow Geese, Creamer's Field, Fairbanks" width="700" height="522" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Snow Geese, Creamer&#8217;s Field, Fairbanks</p></div>
<p>Snow Geese have two color morphs – thought to be different species until 1983. The white morph, shown here, is overwhelmingly the more common color phase seen in Alaska. The &#8220;blue&#8221; morph is more common in the continental flyway.</p>
<div id="attachment_47311" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/700SNGO3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-47311" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/700SNGO3.jpg" alt="Snow Geese, Delta Agricultural Fields, Delta Junction" width="700" height="466" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Snow Geese, Delta Agricultural Fields, Delta Junction</p></div>
<p>The white wings with black primaries are very distinctive in flight. They are nearly as noisy in flight as Canada Geese, but the call is more like baying hounds.</p>
<p>Snow Geese have a habit in common with humans: they tend to destroy the habitat they depend upon for survival. Snow Geese pull up grasses, sedges and other plans, leaving bare mudflats. It&#8217;s known as &#8220;maladaptive behavior.&#8221; Habitat degradation can be so severe that all species not just the Snow Geese, abandon a territory.</p>
<p>WC has seen flocks of tens of thousands of Snow Geese at the Salton Sea in southern California, with the gummy water of the Salton Sea completely covered by noisy, squawking Snow Geese. The great increases in populations are attributed to man&#8217;s agricultural development of their winter range, giving the species much greater winter food sources.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Sometimes life presents its own parables and I try to pay attention. This week my watery cul de sac presented such a story. It has to do with something we don&#8217;t like to talk about often, but hold your nose and we&#8217;ll get through this together.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rural Alaska has a waste issue. Most people on the road system flush their toilets and – well – who knows – it vanished! There are still plenty of places in our fair state that have outhouses. I know what you&#8217;re thinking. There&#8217;s no way I can bring a story about an outhouse back to politics. You&#8217;re wrong, they have more in common than we&#8217;d care to admit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">Back to our story. My neighbor&#8217;s family has been complaining about how their outhouse smells on days the wind forgets to blow. My friend decided what had to be done: tip the outhouse over and burn the waste. Okay, no one wants to think about how to get rid of waste and not many people want to do it, but sometimes it&#8217;s a job that needs to be done.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">As you can imagine, this wasn&#8217;t a fire you want to stand around and warm your hands over. Things seemed to be going along as well as you could expect, until the smoke seemed to be changing colors. The winds shifted, and in my friend&#8217;s attempt to get rid of waste, she burned down the outhouse, art and all. Oh, and the worst of it was, because the fire turned its attention to easier wooden fuel, it forgot it&#8217;s original purpose and left that behind.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">In a related story of getting rid of waste and unintentional destruction, the governor slashed everyone&#8217;s PFDs from about $2,100 down to $1,000 this year. This cut won&#8217;t actually save the state any money, but instead keeps about $700 million in the Permanent Fund Earnings Reserve — so it might be spent another day.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">During the legislative session, the governor&#8217;s team testified it expected the oil industry would accrue over $700 million in oil-tax credits in 2017. It was estimated, by passing HB 247, the bad oil-tax credit bill,  this $700 million figure would be reduced by a measly $5 million to $15 million. Why don&#8217;t they just do a Groupon?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">The governor technically vetoed money for oil-tax credits, but then he signed the bad oil tax credit bill. By doing so, his oil-tax credit veto was not really a cut, but merely a deferral of those payments. Think of it as kicking the honey bucket down the road.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">So your PFD is being cut by $1,100 and that money is being put in a bank to pay for oil-tax credits. Wahoo! Oh, and it is expected we will be paying out roughly $700 million more in oil-tax credits than we get in production taxes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">Look, folks, I&#8217;m on the record complaining about the smell from our political outhouse and asked the governor to burn the waste. Wasteful spending like the Knik Arm bridge, the Susitna hydro dam, and the U-Med road project. Fire in the hole!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">Well, the fire was started with the veto pen, but cuts to education and essential needs are burning down the structure we desperately need. Oh, and sadly, what remains is the same old oil tax crap. Do they write those laws on asbestos?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">My friend is rebuilding her outhouse. There&#8217;s some urgency to the project. While fishing, we discussed what new artwork she should hang on the walls. I suggested a &#8220;Vote Here&#8221; sign. The bigger issue is still what to do with all that unburnt waste.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class=" col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 col-print-12">
<p class="element element-paragraph">It happens. Cleanup is not for the faint of heart.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WC will say at the top these are poor-quality photos. Taken in 2002, WC&#8217;s camera then was something called an <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/olympusc2500l" target="_blank">Olympus C2500L</a>, which was a state of the art camera in its day, but the state of the art was pretty primitive compared to today&#8217;s digital cameras. WC&#8217;s skills left a lot to be desired, too.</p>
<p>But a couple of years ago when WC was featuring <a href="http://www.themudflats.net/archives/41958" target="_blank">Phalaropes</a>, this species got overlooked.</p>
<div id="attachment_47246" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/700REPH.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-47246" src="http://www.themudflats.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/700REPH.jpg" alt="Red Phalarope, Barrow, Alaska" width="700" height="496" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Red Phalarope, Barrow, Alaska</p></div>
<p>The Red Phalarope is the most pelagic of the three phalarope species, spending up to 11 months each year in marine habitats. Its migratory routes and winter areas are entirely pelagic, in contrast to those of <a href="http://www.themudflats.net/archives/41958" target="_blank">Red-necked</a>  and <a href="http://www.themudflats.net/archives/41902" target="_blank">Wilson’s</a> phalaropes, and it generally feeds on smaller invertebrate prey items than the others.</p>

<p>Migrants in Alaska feed on crustaceans in mud plumes created by benthic-foraging gray and bowhead whales. Which is why European whalers to called Red Phalaropes “bowhead birds” and used flocks to locate whales.</p>
<p>Like other phalaropes, Red Phalaropes have reversed sexual dimorphism, with females larger and more brightly plumaged than males. The species breeds widely across the Arctic.</p>
